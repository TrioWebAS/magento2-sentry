## Notable semantic differences

- composer.json name field differs:
  - production: `triowebas/magento2-sentry`
  - master: `justbetter/magento2-sentry`
- Config surface:
  - Changes in `etc/system.xml`, `etc/config.xml`, and `etc/di.xml` align with upstream features (performance tracking, callbacks, cron check-ins, CSP updates).
- Frontend script inclusion:
  - `view/frontend/templates/script/sentry.phtml` updated; upstream uses secureRenderer and CSP domain management.
- Removed profiling-related plugins and DTOs on master, replaced by upstream-native performance tracking and monolog handler integration.

## Risk flags for integration

- Removal of profiling plugins may alter any local instrumentation relying on them.
- Changes to DI and CSP may require cache/config redeploy and environment validation.
- composer.json package name change could impact private packagist/automation if referencing `triowebas/*`.
